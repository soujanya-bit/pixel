# Pixel Grid Drawing Web App

A simple and interactive grid-based drawing tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to create a grid of customizable size and draw by hovering over the squares.

## Features
- **Dynamic Grid Creation**: Generate a grid with user-defined dimensions (up to 100x100).
- **Interactive Drawing**: Hover over squares to change their color.
- **Responsive Design**: Grid resizes dynamically to fit the container.
- **Clear and Recreate**: A button to clear the current grid and create a new one.

## How It Works
1. A 16x16 grid is displayed by default.
2. Hover over the grid squares to draw (change color).
3. Click the "Create New Grid" button to define a new grid size (e.g., 64x64).
4. The total grid area remains fixed, with squares resizing to fit.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for layout and hover effects using Flexbox.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic grid creation and interactivity.
